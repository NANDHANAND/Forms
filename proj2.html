                        Itachi Uchiha, a prodigy, bore the weight of a brutal mission: destroy his clan to save the village. Branded a traitor, he lived in shadow, protecting his brother from afar.
Master of the Mangekyō Sharingan, <strong>his strength was matched only by his sorrow</strong>. In death, his truth emerged—Itachi was a hero hidden behind a villain’s mask.
